## Welcome to my WeatherDataProject
This is from my project from Scripting for Large Databases. It consisted of curating precipitation data from NOAA for two cities: Harrisburg, Pa and Castle Rock, CO. This data focuses specifically on snow fall and comparing how much snowfall these two cities receive with particular attention being paid to whether the year had an El Niño or La Niña in effect.
### Formatting
This is a dataset consisting of three different parts that make up a whole. However, unlike the other repository data I've curated, this data could be used individually. You can use this data by itself for other purposes, but know that the purpose of this data may be limited due to the fact that I was focused on snowfall/winter precipitation.
